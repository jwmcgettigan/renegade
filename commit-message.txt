Have gotten the the car to steer using the lidar.
 -Got all of the bugs out of the new class structures.
 -Major restructuring of auto.py
 -The turning value is derived from a combination of the slopes of the walls and the distance from the walls.
 -probe.py needs to be integrated into process.py (and perhaps an accompanying helper script)
 -It may be better to use Lidar and ZED as classes instead of Controller and Logic. This is debatable.
 -The current values need to be adjusted and smoothed. We may also integrate the distance from the walls at multiple points into our turning value.
 -There are temporarily multiple versions of probe.py and probe1.py
